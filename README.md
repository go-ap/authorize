# Authorization handlers on top of GoActivityPub storage

This project is a standalone server for providing OAuth2 support for GoActivityPub servers that don't expose that functionality themselves.

It was created as a "sidecar" service that would work alongside [FedBOX](https://github.com/go-ap/fedbox).

Please see [the official documentation](https://mariusor.srht.site/apps/fedbox/#authorize-for-c2s-using-oauth2) for how to configure and use it.
